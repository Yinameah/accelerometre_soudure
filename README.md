# accelerometre_soudure
Little arduino and python code for reading acceleration data

It's a little bunch of code for an arduino with accelerometer

Arduino use an ADXL362 accelerometer and send raw data via serial

Python code aquire data and make use of pyqtgraph to visualise data. Data can be stored to an csv file. The csv files can be re-opened for further inspection of data.
Some time marks can be set while aquiring data, and are displayed on the graph when re-opened.
